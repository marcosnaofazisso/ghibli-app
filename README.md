# Ghibli App

## Ghibli App Project
Project made by using React Native framework, Ghibli API with axios. 

### Developers: 
* [Marcos Vinicius Ferreira](https://github.com/marcosnaofazisso) 

## Goals and Rules:
The main goal was to create my first app using React Native framework consuming Ghibli API. 

The app must show all movie titles, banners, original title in japanese and descriptions. Tapping "details" button, the user should be able to see the original title romanised, duration of the movie, release date and director.
